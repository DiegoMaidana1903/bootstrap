I don't have access to the original version of that file. The p5.sound.min.js library is typically a minified file from the p5.sound library.

To restore it, you can:

1. **Download it fresh** from the official p5.sound CDN or GitHub:
    - https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound
    - Or from a CDN like: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.x.x/p5.sound.min.js

2. **If you have a backup**, restore from your version control or file history.

3. **If you need to remove just that code**, delete those lines you added.

Could you clarify what you'd like to do?
